# GuvercinApp

GuvercinApp is an application that provides users with version control, weather information and current data. The project is developed using Flask (server side) and Tkinter (client side).The name GÃ¼vercinApp (Pigeon+App in English) simply describes the entire purpose of the project. Since it was given by a friend who supported the project, it is not possible to change it.


## Features
 **Server Side**
- It has many functions. As the name suggests, it acts as a server, but the application is only suitable for LAN.
- Manages the group feature. It determines the name of the rooms.
- It controls the entry and exit system of the users to the rooms.
- Creates the connection structure.


 **Client Side**
- It determines which room to start in.
- Provides the ability to select a user name.
- Username provides all services that allow you to chat, especially control.


**Security and Anonymity**
- The maximum number of devices in 1 room and application at the same time has not been tested. A simple test with 3 devices at the same time was performed. There is no data for more, but this item will be updated with the volunteers performing the tests. 
- As far as known, there are no problems on the server side, but malicious tests were not performed.
- On the client side, the user has the full initiative to choose the name. Therefore, the choice of how anonymous you want to be is independent of the application.
